You may decide not to participate or you may leave the study at any time.\nYour decision will not result in any penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.\n\nIf you have questions, concerns, or complaints, or think this research has hurt you, talk to the research team at the\nphone number(s) listed in this document.\n\n## Introduction  \nYou are being asked if you would like to participate in the Tidepool Big Data Donation Project which is being conducted\nentirely online by Tidepool and its partners (the \"**Project**\"). Participation in this Project is completely voluntary.\nIt is your choice whether you would like to participate or not. Before agreeing to participate in this Project, you must\nread and understand this consent form. This consent document describes the purpose, procedures, benefits, risks, and\nprecautions of the Project. It also describes the information that may be collected from you as part of this Project,\nhow your information will be used or disclosed, and your right to withdraw from the Project at any time. No guarantees\nor assurances are made to you about the Project results and your participation. If you have any questions about this\nform or the Project, please contact bigdataofficer@tidepool.org. When all of your questions have been answered, you can\ndecide if you want to take part in this Project.\n\n## Background and Purpose  \nThe purpose of this Project is to help drive and expand the boundaries of diabetes research and innovation. This Project\nis an opt-in program designed to help community, academic and industry researchers innovate faster and expand the\nboundaries of knowledge about diabetes. Users of Tidepool's software tools may choose to donate their data. Data\nincluded in this Project will be provided to approved researchers and research teams allowing them access to real-world\npatient data. These researchers, many of whom possess cutting-edge skills and experience in both diabetes and advanced,\nstate-of-the-art machine learning techniques, may use this anonymized data in simulations to build models in the\ndevelopment of new strategies for diabetes management, or in general to uncover novel real-world insights into how to\nbetter treat people with diabetes. Many have a specific focus around next-generation automated insulin delivery\ntechniques.\n\n## Eligible Participants  \nParticipation in this Project is open to all Tidepool members in the US with a Tidepool account and are over the age of\n18 years old. If you are under the age of 18 and would like to participate your parent or legal guardian must provide\ntheir consent by signing this form. You can participate in this Project for as long as you are interested in\nparticipating. This is a longitudinal research project and we hope to continue this Project for years to come.\n\n## Project Procedures  \nIf you choose to participate in the Project, you will need to create, or have already created, a Tidepool account,\nfollow the instructions to verify your account and set up Data Storage. During this process you, will need to indicate\nyour interest in participating in the Project, review this form, and give your consent. You can select a nonprofit\ndiabetes organization to support; Tidepool will share some of the revenue generated by licensing datasets with these\norganizations. You will then be asked to start uploading your data. We recommend setting a reminder to upload your data,\nor checking your data connections, at least once a month to make sure you don't have any data gaps.\n\nTidepool will create a copy of the Tidepool member data about you (e.g., information you provided when using your\nTidepool account). Tidepool will anonymize the data by removing directly identifying information, including your name,\nemail address, custom labeled profiles, and device identifiers, associated with this information and assign a unique\nidentifier to the data before including the anonymized data in the pool of datasets that are made available to data\npartners and researchers.\n\nInformation that will be included in the pool of datasets available to researchers, includes:\n\n* **Demographic Information**: such as your age, biological sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, education level,\n  and general geographic location.\n* **Health and Device Information**: such as diabetes type, diagnosis month and year, insulin delivery data, carb\n  entries, events tracked by the continuous glucose meters (\"CGM\") including estimated glucose values, meals, exercise,\n  blood glucose (\"BG\") readings and log, trends, basal rates, insulin to carb ratios, insulin sensitivity factors,\n  device generated alerts and alarms, device component changes, and upload history.\n* **Survey Information**: such as your responses to how your experience in the Project is, questions about your health\n  habits and wellness, and other information you may choose to provide in response to surveys that may be provided from\n  time to time as part of the Project.\n\nThe specific types of information included may vary slightly depending on your devices and how you use Tidepool\nsoftware.\n\nBy participating in this Project, you can support other diabetes non-profit organizations. Any time an industry partner\nuses Tidepool's paid dataset qualification services, Tidepool will donate 10% of the proceeds to a non-profit\norganization of your choice.\n\n## Risks  \nThere are risks, discomforts, and inconveniences associated with any research study. These deserve careful thought.\nThere may be risks to your privacy. Your privacy is important to us and we will take precautions to protect your\nprivacy, but we cannot guarantee that your identity will never become known. Despite the precautions we take, it is\npossible that there could be security breaches of the computer systems used to store your information or the identifiers\nlinking your Project data to you. If you post a subset of your data online, a researcher may be able to match data\nwithin the Project to the data you've posted online, and re-identify your dataset (please note that this would be in\nviolation of the terms of use of the Project data set license). There may also be other privacy risks that we have not\nforeseen.\n\nThere is also a possibility of risks that we do not know about. If you have any questions or concerns, you should speak\nwith the Tidepool's Big Data Donation Project officer [bigdataofficer@tidepool.org](mailto:bigdataofficer@tidepool.org).\n\nBy agreeing to this consent form, you do not give up any of your legal rights against the researchers, sponsor or\ninvolved institutions, nor does this form relieve the researchers, sponsor or involved institutions of their legal and\nprofessional responsibilities.\n\n## Benefits and Alternatives  \nYou will not be paid for taking part in this Project and you may not receive direct benefit from being in this Project.\nThis Project is for research and innovation purposes only.

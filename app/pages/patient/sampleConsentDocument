## Tidepool Big Data Donation Project
# Informed Consent Form

## Introduction

You are being asked if you would like to participate in the Tidepool Big Data Donation Project which is being conducted entirely online by Tidepool and its partners (the “Project”). Participation in this Project is completely voluntary. It is your choice whether you would like to participate or not. Before agreeing to participate in this Project, you must read and understand this consent form. This consent document describes the purpose, procedures, benefits, risks, and precautions of the Project. It also describes the information that may be collected from you as part of this Project, how your information will be used or disclosed, and your right to withdraw from the Project at any time. No guarantees or assurances are made to you about the Project results and your participation. If you have any questions about this form or the Project, please contact bigdataofficer@tidepool.org. When all of your questions have been answered, you can decide if you want to take part in this Project.

## Background and Purpose

The purpose of this Project is to help drive and expand the boundaries of diabetes research and innovation. This Project is an opt-in program designed to help community, academic and industry researchers innovate faster and expand the boundaries of knowledge about diabetes. Users of Tidepool’s software tools may choose to donate their data. Data included in this Project will be provided to approved researchers and research teams allowing them access to real-world patient data. These researchers, many of whom possess cutting-edge skills and experience in both diabetes and advanced, state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, may use this anonymized data in simulations to build models in the development of new strategies for diabetes management, or in general to uncover novel real-world insights into how to better treat people with diabetes. Many have a specific focus around next-generation automated insulin delivery techniques.

## Eligible Participants

Participation in this Project is open to all Tidepool members in the US with a Tidepool account and are over the age of 18 years old. If you are under the age of 18 and would like to participate your parent or legal guardian must provide their consent by signing this form. You can participate in this Project for as long as you are interested in participating. This is a longitudinal research project and we hope to continue this Project for years to come.

## Project Procedures

If you choose to participate in the Project, you will need to create, or have already created, a Tidepool account, follow the instructions to verify your account and set up Data Storage. During this process you will need to check the option to “Donate your anonymized data.” You can select a nonprofit diabetes organization to support; Tidepool will share some of the revenue generated by licensing datasets with these organizations. You will then be asked to start uploading your data. We recommend setting a reminder to upload your data, or checking your data connections, at least once a month to make sure you don’t have any data gaps.

Tidepool will create a copy of the Tidepool member data about you (e.g., information you provided when using your Tidepool account). Tidepool will anonymize the data by removing directly identifying information, including your name, email address, custom labeled profiles, and device identifiers, associated with this information and assign a unique identifier to the data before including the anonymized data in the pool of datasets that are made available to data partners and researchers. 

Information that will be included in the pool of datasets available to researchers, includes:
 - Demographic Information: such as your age, biological sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, education level, and general geographic location.
 - Health and Device Information: such as diabetes type, diagnosis month and year, insulin delivery data, carb entries, events tracked by the continuous glucose meters (“CGM”) including estimated glucose values, meals, exercise,  blood glucose (“BG”) readings and log, trends, basal rates, insulin to carb ratios, insulin sensitivity factors, device generated alerts and alarms, device component changes, and upload history.
 - Survey Information: such as your responses to how your experience in the Project is, questions about your health habits and wellness, and other information you may choose to provide in response to surveys that may be provided from time to time as part of the Project.

The specific types of information included may vary slightly depending on your devices and how you use Tidepool software.

By participating in this Project, you can support other diabetes non-profit organizations. Any time an industry partner uses Tidepool's paid dataset qualification services, Tidepool will donate 10% of the proceeds to a non-profit organization of your choice.

## Risks

There are risks, discomforts, and inconveniences associated with any research study. These deserve careful thought. There may be risks to your privacy. Your privacy is important to us and we will take precautions to protect your privacy, but we cannot guarantee that your identity will never become known. Despite the precautions we take, it is possible that there could be security breaches of the computer systems used to store your information or the identifiers linking your Project data to you. If you post a subset of your data online, a researcher may be able to match data within the Project to the data you’ve posted online, and re-identify your dataset (please note that this would be in violation of the terms of use of the Project data set license). There may also be other privacy risks that we have not foreseen.

There is also a possibility of risks that we do not know about. If you have any questions or concerns, you should speak with the The Tidepool Big Data Donation Project officer bigdataofficer@tidepool.org.

By agreeing to this consent form, you do not give up any of your legal rights against the researchers, sponsor or involved institutions, nor does this form relieve the researchers, sponsor or involved institutions of their legal and professional responsibilities.

## Benefits and Alternatives

You will not be paid for taking part in this Project and you may not receive direct benefit from being in this Project. This Project is for research and innovation purposes only. The only alternative is to not participate in this Project. If you choose to not take part in this Project, you will not lose any benefits or medical care to which you are otherwise entitled. You do not have to agree to this consent form, but if you do not, you will not be able to participate in this Project.  

Information learned in this Project may help people with diabetes in the future, but individual or aggregate research results may not be reported back to you. If the Project or related research leads to the development of new or the improvement of existing diagnostic tests, treatments, patents, therapies, or other commercial products, you will not receive any part of the profits generated from such products.

## Withdrawal from the Project

You can decide to leave the Project at any time. You can opt out of this Project by logging into your account, clicking on the account name at the top of the page to navigate to your profile settings, unchecking “Donate my anonymized data” and then clicking “Save.” 

If you decide to opt out of the Project, the information that was collected before you left the Project will still be used to support this Project, and the previously donated/anonymized data cannot be removed. No new information will be collected without your permission. 

You may be asked to leave the Project early for reasons such as:
 - the Project team does not believe that this Project is in your best interest;
 - it is discovered that you do not meet the Project eligibility requirements;
 - the Project is canceled for any reason; or
 - for administrative reasons.

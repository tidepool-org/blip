## tidepool-viz's usage of Redux

Aside from [our general views on React best practices at Tidepool](http://developer.tidepool.io/docs/front-end/react/index.html 'Tidepool developer portal: React @ Tidepool'), to develop code in this repository you should take a look at [redux-form](http://redux-form.com/6.2.0/ 'redux-form'), the project that inspired how we're using redux in an internal dependency library.

More to come!
